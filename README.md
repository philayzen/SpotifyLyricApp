# Spotify Lyric App

Uses spotify repository as core functionality. The webapp starts the spotify-project to host the website and calls it.

# Limitations
Due to a change in Spotify's policies, new lyrics can't be retrieved anymore. Therefore, only songs in database can be retrieved. 
Future work consists of using lrclib as the source for lyrics, however, that requires a large amount of space and it has to be hosted.
